# UnisonDB Examples

Get hands-on with **UnisonDB** through practical examples that demonstrate how to deploy, replicate, and synchronize data across distributed systems.  
Each tutorial highlights a real-world use case — from **single-node configurations** to **multi-region CRDT replication** and **real-time streaming** at the edge.

### [1. How to Build Conflict-Free Multi-Datacenter Systems with CRDTs and UnisonDB](multi-dc-crdts/)

Learn how to design globally replicated systems that stay consistent without coordination.  
This example walks you through using [**Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type) with **UnisonDB’s WAL-based replication** to achieve [**eventual consistency**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) across data centers.
